My name is Guo Jinchao(郭金超). You can call me Mike. I was born in 1994.

I am a front-end development engineer.The current technology stack is react/node.

I graduated from jiangsu university and currently work for an Internet company in hangzhou.

In spare time, I like reading book, surfing internet, watching movie and taking a leisurely walk outdoors.
